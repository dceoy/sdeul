# Progress

## What Works (Assumed based on file structure & tests)

*   Basic project structure is in place.
*   Dependency management using Poetry is set up.
*   Testing frameworks (`pytest`, `bats`) are integrated.
*   Core modules (`cli`, `llm`, `extraction`, `validation`, `utility`) exist.
*   Some level of functionality is likely implemented, given the presence of tests for various LLM providers (`test/bats/`).
*   Added CLI option (`--aws-profile`) and environment variable support (`AWS_PROFILE`) for specifying AWS credentials profile for Bedrock usage.

## What's Left to Build / Refine

*   Detailed implementation review of each module (`sdeul/*.py`).
*   Confirmation of support and functionality for *all* listed LLM providers.
*   Assessment of test coverage and identification of gaps.
*   Review and potential refinement of error handling and reporting.
*   Documentation improvements (docstrings, README updates if needed).
*   Verification of library usability (`__init__.py` interface).

## Current Status

*   Memory Bank initialized.
*   High-level project structure and technology stack identified.
*   Awaiting detailed code review to understand the precise implementation status and capabilities.

## Known Issues / Areas for Investigation

*   Confirmed API keys/credentials can be managed via environment variables and CLI arguments (details in `techContext.md`).
*   Need to verify the exact library functions exposed (`__init__.py`).
*   Need to run tests to confirm current pass/fail status.
*   Consider adding tests specifically for the `--aws-profile` functionality.
